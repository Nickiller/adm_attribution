Dear CBA users,

     CBA(UNIX) is a unix version of CBA. This version is purely designed for 
testing. Hence, interface is not a major concern. The purpose of releasing
this version is to let researchers have better understanding of CBA.  

     CBA(UNIX) has 2 major operations, classification & cross-validation. 
The classification portion cannot take continuous attributs, and you have
to discretise it before running.
   
     In the cross-validation portion, split will be done exactly following 
the C4.5. In each split, discretiser only runs against training part. Testing 
part will not be seen to discretiser. 

     You enter cross-validation options from command line (please refer to
program for more details). 

Check List:
